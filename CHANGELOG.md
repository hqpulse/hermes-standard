Earlier versions are in the git history (`git log --oneline v0.1.1..v0.2.2`).

## 0.2.3 (2026-09-07)

- **Humanizer skill.** `skills/humanizer/` is blader/humanizer (MIT, license
  file kept, SKILL.md verbatim from upstream main on 2026-09-07). The
  assistant-standard skill now says to run it over anything written for
  someone else: a mail draft, a note that will be shared, a document. The pass
  may change how a thing reads, never what it says, and a note to a patient, a
  resident's family, a clinician or anyone outside the company gets no pass at
  all.
- **Open commitments file.** The skill names `Open commitments.md` in the
  vault root: one table (owner, owed to, what, due, since), rewritten nightly
  from the commitment notes. The three shipped Bases stay.
- **Presets.** `skills/assistant-standard/presets/`: `morning-brief.json`
  (weekdays 08:00, ends in a 60-second voice note), `meeting-prep.json`
  (weekdays 07:30, one pre-read per meeting), `open-commitments.json`
  (nightly, silent). Each asks once on its first run whether the person wants
  it, in its own words rather than a shared line, so an answer names what it
  belongs to; the skill says how keep, change and stop are handled in chat,
  including matching an answer to the right job when two are outstanding. Each
  ships
  `deliver: __HOME_CHANNEL__`, a placeholder the controller substitutes with
  the person's own home platform and chat id; left unsubstituted the job is
  blocked at preflight rather than delivered to whichever channel happens to be
  connected. The mechanics and what the controller must allow are in
  `presets/README.md`.
- **Dossier prompt.** `references/DOSSIER.md`, the fixed prompt the staff
  button posts: context skill body under 6,000 characters plus five to eight
  USER.md entries; never figures, another customer, pay or HR matters.
- **Memory wording pinned.** Preferences and stable facts go to memory; dated
  facts, a named person's matters and anything with money go to a vault note,
  never to memory. SOUL.md's one-line rule now says the same.
- **Reminders deliver to the phone**, never back to the chat door.
- Every new file the pack ships is listed in `distribution_owned`: with an
  explicit list, only listed paths reach the pod at all.
- `tests/check_pack.py`: frontmatter, preset payloads and manifest checks.
